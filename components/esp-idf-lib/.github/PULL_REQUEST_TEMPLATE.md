**IMPORTANT**: Please **do not create a Pull Request** without
[creating an issue](https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib/issues/new/choose)
first.

Include `fixes` or other supported keywords that links a PR to an
issue in either a commit log or the PR. See
[Linking a pull request to an issue using a keyword](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword)
for the keywords.

Make sure your branch is up-to-date with the latest `master` branch. If it is
not, do `git rebase master`.

After creating a PR, make sure all the tests in the CI pass. If you cannot
understand why a test fails, ask for help.
